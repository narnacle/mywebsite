    <p>If you want to get in touch to say hi or share something positive, please reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/NarnacleDigital">Twitter</a>. I make an effort to respond to as many tweets as I can. For inquiries about video-making or sharing your work with me, <a href="https://twitter.com/NarnacleDigital">Twitter</a> is also the best way to reach me. While I understand that it's not as personal as sending an email, my inbox is quite chaotic, and when I made it public, I received an overwhelming number of messages that unfortunately went unread, which is disappointing for everyone involved.</p>
    <p>If you're in Cluj-Napoca and wish to connect personally, discuss a business idea, or request my time for a call or meeting, I have to politely decline. As much as I'd like to accommodate every request, my priorities lie with my family first, work second, and the little remaining time I have is for personal activities like going to the gym or running. Unfortunately, this leaves no room for additional commitments, even if it means missing out on opportunities.</p>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/paulg">Paul Graham</a> eloquently explains why agreeing to a quick coffee can disrupt the creative process; I recommend reading his <a href="https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">insights</a> on the maker's schedule. Additionally, <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanHoliday">Ryan Holiday</a> wrote a compelling <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/01/to-everyone-who-asks-for-just-a-little-of-your-time/">essay</a> addressing the significance of guarding one's time against countless requests for just a small portion of it. It's a brilliant piece that resonates deeply with me, although I wish I had written it myself.</p>
    <p>I apologize for having to decline, but it's a decision made with careful consideration and for valid reasons.</p>
